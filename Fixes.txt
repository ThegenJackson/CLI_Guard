password generator:
- random password generator
- create a password algorythm to layer on top of passwords
- pass phrase generator

each has settings that persist through sessions by updating the sqlite3 generator settings table or a .config file



FIX THESE THINGS
Create Password Popup needs ESC to exit
Create Password Popup fix button navigation
Search Passwords Popup fix buttons and navigation
Exiting Search Passwords Popup reverts data table, needs to retain sort and search results unless removed
The Create Passwords Popup does not revert the data table so need to model off how that is working


Pyperclip does not seem to be platform agnostic so consider replacing with the following
	To use native Python directories, use:

	import subprocess

	def copy2clip(txt):
		cmd='echo '+txt.strip()+'|clip'
		return subprocess.check_call(cmd, shell=True)
	on Mac, instead:

	import subprocess

	def copy2clip(txt):
		cmd='echo '+txt.strip()+'|pbcopy'
		return subprocess.check_call(cmd, shell=True)
