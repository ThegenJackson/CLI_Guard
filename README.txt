#   - Update README to link to all relevant Docs needed
#	- User can download SQLite Studio to interact with DB
#   - Decided to use SQLite over MySQL due to SQLite being
#		more lightweight and restricted to only 1 user
#   - Decided to split the app into CLI app as well as GUI app
#   - Terminal app to be saved as SPM.py, execute at CLI with "python SPM.py"
#   - GUI app to use Tkinter and to be packed into .exe
#   - GUI to be saved as SimplePasswordManager.exe
#   - Both CLI and GUI apps to access same DB
